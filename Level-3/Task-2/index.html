                    I recently completed a web development internship at Cognifiz, where I explored new tools like the Bulma CSS framework, which I found both intuitive and powerful. I also deepened my understanding of JavaScript, focusing on advanced concepts like fetch,
                    promises, and asynchronous operations. Additionally, I gained practical experience in managing projects, balancing deadlines, and collaborating effectively with team members. This internship has significantly broadened my technical
                    skill set and reinforced the importance of continuous learning in the fast-evolving field of web development
